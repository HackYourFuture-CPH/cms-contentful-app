# Hack Your Future - Next.js + Contentful workshop

Welcome to the repo for this workshop!

## What we will talk about:

- What is a full-stack framework
- Next.js
- What are the different rendering strategies you can chose from (use cases and benefits):
  - Client Side Rendering (CSR)
  - Server Side Rendering (SSR)
  - Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Client Components and Server Components
- Brief intro to the concept of a CMS. We will specifically use Contentful for this project.

## What you should do before the workshop:

- [ ] Research Next.js default project structure (checkout the repo)
- [ ] Go through the [How to run the project](#how-to-run-the-project) and make sure to setup and run the app
- [ ] Research App router:
  - What is file-based routing?
  - Creating a new page
  - Creating dynamic pages
  - Linking between pages
- [ ] If you have never encountered Typescript yet, watch or read some brieft introduction to it

Don't worry if you don't have enough time to go through all of this contents. We will do a quick refresher in the workshop.

The main focus of the workshop will be to introduce you to Next.js as a full-stack framework and focus on rendering strategies so you start grasping new and more advanced concepts that will help you in the future.

## How to run the project

1. Create a `.env.local` file at the root level and add the following environment variables:

```
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=...
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

The values for these variables will be provided in private through Slack. We are now a developer team and we don't post any secrets in public ðŸ˜‰

2. After having setup the `.env.local` file, install dependencies and run the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

<br/>

> This setup connects you to an already created Contentful account to fetch content from. If you want to create and use your own Contentful account, follow the dedicated guide [here](/README_configure_Contentful.md).
> <br/>
> It is not required to have your own Contenful account (as you can utilize the already setup account) and it takes time to get it working, so evaluate your time and energy resources wisely.

3.  - <!-- A small task to change something, take a screenshot of it running and reflected on the screen and post in slack?
      (To make sure all the participants get it setup and running and keep track of how the preparation is going.)  -->
